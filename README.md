# geb-groovy-pom
This repository is the result of my independent project to train certain things in POM QA Automation.

This is a basic POM project.

I spent 2 days on the realization and setting up this project. Groovy programming language was used to write the code.

The Web Shop that I chose for testing is [N Selection](https://www.nselection.rs/), and I had no intention of harming the company itself, but only to increase and improve my skills.

Side information: To use the application in a special environment the author accepts no responsibility if you cause damage to third parties
